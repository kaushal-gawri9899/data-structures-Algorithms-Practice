/**
 * Given a non-negative integer num represented as a string, remove k digits from the number so that the new number is the smallest possible.
 * Note:
 * The length of num is less than 10002 and will be â‰¥ k.
 * The given num does not contain any leading zero.
 * 
 * Input: num = "1432219", k = 3
 * Output: "1219"
 * Explanation: Remove the three digits 4, 3, and 2 to form the new number 1219 which is the smallest.
